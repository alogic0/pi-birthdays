# pi-birthdays
The places in the Pi number where all dates (1902-2020) appear.

Thanks to the site http://www.subidiom.com/pi/  
we can check occurences of any sequence of digits in 
the initial 2 billions part of the famous `Pi` number.

I've checked all dates from 1902-01-01 through 2020-12-31 
and all of them were there. The complete list of dates and the 
first places of appearance inside `Pi` is in the `bdays.txt` file. 
Its size is 2.2M.
